I'm currently learning Flutter as it was kind of interesting. Followed these codelabs from Google from start to finish:

* [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-flutter)
* [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-103-flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-103-flutter)
* [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-104-flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-104-flutter)
